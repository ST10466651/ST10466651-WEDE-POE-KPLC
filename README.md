The goal is to create a visually captivating, emotionally resonant, and highly functional website for a preschool that serves children aged 12 months to 6 years. The platform will act as the schoolâ€™s digital front door, offering prospective and current parents everything they need to feel confident, informed, and connected.
This site must do more than just look good - it must perform well under load, build emotional trust, and communicate the school's unique value through thoughtful structure, content, and interactivity.
